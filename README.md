# network_charity_analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to use our knowledge of machine learning nd neural networks to provide a dataset on applicants, to help predict whether they will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We reprocessed data for the neural network model, as well as compiled, trained, and evaluated it for optimization and results.

## Results

We assessed whether the funding proved to be influential towards success, by considering variables such as successfullness, classification, and application_type. We excluded 'EIN' and 'NSME' columns.

## Summary
 I was unable to achieve 75% for the model accuracy.
